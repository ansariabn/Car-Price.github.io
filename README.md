# Car Price Prediction Model

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction Model repository! This project focuses on predicting the prices of cars based on their features.

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine-learning model that predicts the price of cars using a dataset of car specifications. The model is built using Python and scikit-learn.

## Features
- Predicts car prices based on input features.
- Built using ridge regression.
- Utilizes a dataset of car specifications and prices.

## Usage
To use the car price prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the model code.
3. Input the features of a car (such as horsepower, mileage, etc.).
4. Run the code to obtain the predicted car price.
